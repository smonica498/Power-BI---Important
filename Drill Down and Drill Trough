//Creating New Pages:
Main Page is renamed as Branch Overview
Right Click on Branch Overview -> Duplicate Page
OR
Go to Insert Tab -> New Page -> Duplicate Page


//Applying Drill-Down to a visual
For example,
Bar char1: Revenue vs Date Hierarchy 
Bar chart2: Revenue vs Year, Quarter, Month, Day
When selecting any visual for example Bar chart2, Go to Data/Drill -> Apply Drill down filters to -> Entire Page/ Selected Visual
First button is Drill Up (one up arrow)
Second button is Drill Down (one down arrow)
Third button is Go to the next level in the hierarchy (two down arrow)
Forth button is Expand all down one level in hierarchy (Looks like Decision Tree)

If do not want 1 KPI to interact with other visuals then,
Click on the visual eg. Bar chart, Go to Format Tab -> Edit Interactions -> Click on None button just beneath that KPI viz



//Using the Table Visual
Click on Table Viz
Under Values:
Select Account Handler
Undeer Measures select Revenue, Total Units Sold, Maximum Order Value
Click on Slicer (Filter based on location for example)
So this way we get the the page for a particular location for example
and then delete the slicer



//Top N Customers
Click on Table Viz
Values: Customer Name, Revenue, Units
Format: Title - Top 6 Customers
In Filters pane, under Filters on this visual: Customer Name. Filter Type: Top N, Show Items: Top 6, By value: Revenue
Click on Apply Button



//The TREE MAP Visual
Click on Tree Map viz
Group: Product Range
Values: Revenue
Format Viz: Data labels, Data Colors - has separate color range for diff. Advanced can do the same color with varinats in shade based on values

Click on Bar chart. Values: Reveneue, Axis: Product
Format: Switch off x axis, Data labels - Display units: 1000s, Value decimal places: 1, Position: Inside end, Overflow text: ON



//Config Visual Interactions
Case 1: We do not want this KPI to change with any filters/interactions with other viz
For example, 6 year trend viz needs to stay the same during interaction with other filters.
So, we select a viz eg. Bar chart, Go to Format -> Edit Interactions -> Under that 6 year trend viz click on the None button
Case 2: Only a few fields can filter a particular KPI
For example, Target varince needs to stay the same when we click on a particular value on a Table of Account Handler
So, we select that Table of Account Handler, Go to Format -> Edit Interactions -> Under that 6 year trend viz and Revenue KPI click on the None button
Case 3: All viz interactions

If we want to show the viz's interacted vales and not the highlighted vales for the particualr seleted field,
File -> Option & Settings -> Options -> Current File -> Report Settings -> Under Visual options select Change default visual interaction from cross highlighting to cross filtering
When we want the intercations to Highlight,
Just beside the None button, there shoudl be a Highlight button on the left of None



//Preparing a Drill-Through Page:
On the Main Branch Overview Page, Right click on a particular field on a particular viz -> Drill through -> Branch Focus
This will show the filters of the selected Field and take to another Branch Focus page

To create this:
In Branch Focus page, in viz pane, Add Drill-through fields under Drill through
Swithc of Keep all filters (if not required)
Power BI automatically creates a Back button on the top left of the page
Right click on Branch Focus page and then click on Hide Page



//Creating a drill-through button:
Under Main Branch Overview Page
Click on Intsert Tab -> Buttons -> Blank
Format: Button Text: Click Here to Drill-through to slected Branch; Action: ON, Type: Drill-through, Destination: Branch Focus page, Enabled Tooltip



//Configuring a Tooltip page:
Create a new page: Branch Tooltip (Right click and Hide)

Go to View Tab -> Page View -> Actual Size
In Filters pane, Account Handler filed - Filter Type: Top N, Show Items: Top 3, By Value: Revenue. then click on Apply Filter
Format: Title: Top 3 (Drill-through for more)
....
General: Width: 235, Height: 105
Move that viz to the top left side
Now make sure nothing is slected
In viz pane, Under page information, Switch on Tool tip, Page Size: Tooltip (This changes the width to 320, Height to 240 so prefer to change to custom and manually change the width to 235 and height to 105 matching the content)
Now, Under View Tab -> Page View -> Actual Size
Now under viz pane, make sure Tooltip is ON and drag branch under Tooltip fields
Now, In the main Branch Overview page, select all the viz that contains Branch and we wanna see the tooltip while hovering over the brances,
Go to Format, Click on Tooltip. Type: Report Page, Page: Branch Tooltip
