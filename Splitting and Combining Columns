/////Section 1: Split by Delimiter

//Identifying Text Issues
• When looking to clean up a text column, it is always useful
to know what you are looking for; and one way of doing
this is to copy the column into Microsoft Word and review
the invisible characters.
• Right-click the text column and Choose “Copy”.
• Once the data is pasted into Microsoft Word, activate the
Show Hidden Characters feature to identify the invisible
characters.
• A dot represents a space and the arrow symbol represents
a Tab character.


//Trim and Clean
• The Trim command removes leading and trailing spaces from a
text column.
• The Clean command removes white space characters like tabs
and returns.
• To use these commands, either:
• Right-click the text column and choose Transform > Format >
Trim/Clean
• In the Ribbon, click Transform > Format > Trim/Clean.


//Split Column by Delimiter
• The Split Column by Delimiter command creates new columns
by splitting text entries wherever the specified delimiter
occurs.
• When using the Split Column by Delimiter command,
activating the option Left-most delimiter ensures that only
two columns will be created.




/////Section 2: Character Transition

//Split by Character Transition
• Power Query contains four useful commands for splitting
columns according to a transition from one kind of
character to another, i.e., at the point where a key attribute
of the characters changes:
• By Lowercase to uppercase
• By Uppercase to lowercase
• By Digit to non-digit
• By Non-digit to digit
• For example, if a variable number of digits is followed by
text, we can use the command Split Column > Digit to Non-
Digit to separate the characters following the leading digits
into a new column.



/////Section 3: Combining Columns:

//Merge Columns
• The merge columns command combines the selected
columns into a single column using the specified
“Separator”.
• The merge columns command combines the selected
columns into a single column using the specified
“Separator”.
• When combining columns using Transform > Merge
Columns, the order in which you select the columns
determines the order in which the columns will be merged.
• The Power Query Merge Columns command can be found
on both the Transform and Add Column Tabs of the Ribbon.
• Using Transform > Merge Columns replaces the merge
columns, whereas Add Columns > Merge Columns
preserves the existing columns.
• Using Right-click > Merge Columns is equivalent to
Transform > Merge Columns.

//Merge Columns & Query Folding
• When transforming queries which connect to database
servers, such as SQL Server and Oracle, Merge Columns is
one of those commands which cannot be query folded (i.e.,
it cannot be converted into a native SQL command to be
executed by the server).

//Add Column > Custom Column
• Unlike Merge Columns, using the more basic command Add
Column > Custom Column to create a concatenated column,
generates a step which will be query-folded.
• The Add Column > Custom Column command displays a
dialog into which you can enter M language code.
• To combine columns, simply enter the names of the columns
using the “&” character for concatenation.
• The Custom Column dialog is fairly user-friendly. Doubleclicking
a column in the “Available columns” list inserts the
M code reference to that column.


//Data Type
• Using the Merge Columns command always generates a text
column. However, when using Add Column > Custom column,
you must manually specify the data type of the new column.
