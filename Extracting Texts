/////Section 1: Character Ranges:

//Transform > Extract
• The commands found in the Transform > Extract and Add
Column > Extract sub-menus are designed to extract
substrings from a single piece of text.
• The commands in the Transform Tab will modify the
selected column, the Add Column equivalent will retain the
original column and extract text into a new column.

//First Characters
• Extract > First Characters returns the specified number of
characters from the start of a string and is equivalent to
Microsoft Excel's LEFT function.

//Last Characters
• The command Extract > Last Characters returns the specified
number of characters from the end of a string and is
equivalent to Excel's RIGHT function.

//Range
• The command Extract > Range returns the specified number
of characters from the middle of a string and is equivalent to
Excel's MID function.
• When specifying the starting index, remember that, in the M
language, the first character position has an index of zero, not
one.



/////Section 2: Between Delimiters:

//Text Between Delimiters
• The command Extract > Text Between Delimiters returns
the text between the two specified delimiters.
• The Text Between Delimiters dialog allows you to specify
different start and end delimiters.
Advanced options allow you to specify whether to scan the
text from the start or end and which occurrence of the two
delimiters to target.



/////Section 3: Before Delimiter:

//Text Before Delimiter
• The command Extract > Text Before Delimiter returns the
text before the specified delimiter.
• As we can see in this example, when using the Text Before,
After and Between delimiters commands, the delimiter can
contain multiple characters.

//Replace Values
• The Replace Values command, which works in a similar way
to Find and Replace, can be used to iron out minor
discrepancies in the text being used as the delimiter.
