/////Section 1: Removing Rows:

//Removing Metadata:
• One common attribute of data which is essentially a report
is rows of metadata preceding the actual data; for example,
the name, date and author of the report.
• Remove Rows > Remove Top Rows can be used to eliminate
these non-data rows.


//Repaeting Rows:
• If data contains analysis rows embedded within the data,
such as sub-totals, Remove Rows > Remove Alternate Rows
can be used to remove these embedded rows.
• Specify the first row to remove, the number of rows to
remove and the number of rows to keep.


//Filtering our Rows:
• When rows need to be removed, filtering is often an
option.
• Filtering is useful when the row entries are known in
advance.



/////Section 2: Fill Down:

//Embedded Sub-Headings:
• Report data sometimes contains embedded headings.
• This means that some columns contain blanks instead of
data labels, preventing accurate data analysis.

//Fill Down:
• The Fill Down
command will copy
each sub-heading down
into the blank rows
below; but it will never
overwrite an entry,
since the command
only fills empty rows.


//Blank versus Null:
• However, the Fill Down command will only replace null
values, and Power BI does not treat blank entries as null.

//Replace Values:
• If rows are empty, prior to using Fill Down, we can use
Replace Values to insert nulls instead of blanks; entering
nothing in “Value to find”, and lowercase “null” in “Replace
with”.

//Fill Down now Works:
• Once the rows below the embedded sub-headings contain
null values, Fill Down will produce the correct result.




/////Section 3: unpivot Columns:


//Pivoted Data
• One of the attributes which reporting data sometimes
contains is pivoting, where the elements within a category
have been separated out into columns like a pivot table.
• Pivoted data is difficult to analyze, since it has already been
separated into preset categories.


//Unpivot Columns
• The Unpivot Columns command transposes the pivoted
columns into two new columns called “Attribute” and “Value”.
• The “Attribute” column contains the original column headings,
while the “Value” column contains the entries which were
underneath each of those headings.


//Table.UnpivotOtherColumns
• The M syntax generated when the Unpivot Columns
command is used is Table.UnpivotOtherColumns, a function
which references the columns not being unpivoted.
• If you wish to generated the Table.UnpivotColumns
command, which explicitly references the columns to be
unpivoted, use the command Unpivot Only Selected
Columns.




/////Section 4: Report Cteation:


//Background Image Fit:
• When importing a background image, you can resize the
image to fit the Power BI canvas precisely by choosing Fit
from the Image Fit dropdown in the Format > Background
settings.

//DAX Measures:
Unlike calculated columns, which produce a result for each
row in a table, DAX measures display a result only when
added to one of the fields in a visual.

//Measure Syntax:
• The syntax for creating a measure is:
Name of Measure = Formula.
• Pressing Shift-Enter to split your formulas onto separate lines
makes them easier to read.
• Pressing Shift-Plus or Shift-Minus increases or decreases the
font size in the formula bar.
Rating Stars = 
REPT(UNICHAR(9733), AVERAGE(Response[Rating])) &
REPT(UNICHAR(9734), 10 - AVERAGE(Responses[Rating]))


//REPT Function
The DAX REPT function generates the specified number of
instances of a text string.
• The syntax of the REPT function is:
REPT(<text>, <num_times>)
where <text> is the text to be repeated, either a literal string
or a text function
and <num_times> is the number of times you wish to repeat
the string.


//UNICHAR Function:
• The DAX UNICHAR function returns the Unicode character
referenced by specified number.
• The syntax of the function is:
UNICHAR(number)
• The single argument (number) is the Unicode number that
represents the character.


//Filled and Unfilled Stars:
• UNICHAR(9733) returns a filled star character.
• UNICHAR(9734) returns an unfilled star.
• BTW, to look up or search for Unicode characters, visit the
website unicode-table.com.


//Table Column Format:
• The text font and background colours used in the table visual
can be changed on an individual column basis.
• In the Field Formatting section of the Format pane, choose a
column from the dropdown, then set the Font and
Background colours as required.
